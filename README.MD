Please note: This model was trained on unfiltered data and may produce sensitive content. The main purpose of creating this model was to improve my understanding of fine-tuning and transformers for building AI systems like GPT.

If you choose to use or fine-tune this model, you are free to do so; however, the results, unfiltered answers, and functionality are not guaranteed, and you may not claim any rights over it later.

Instruction:
